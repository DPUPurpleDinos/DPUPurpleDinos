# Dino Travel

Hi! This account holds the repositories to the frontend and backend of our capstone project.

## About

For DePaul's 2022 Winter Quarter capstone (CSC394/IS396), we were tasked with creating a fullstack CRUD application.

Over the course of 2 months, we created a flight booking system. We used the [Amadeus API](https://developers.amadeus.com/) to get live flight data and locations. Users are able to login through a Google account and can create a one-way, round-trip, or multi-city flight booking. Once the booking is completed, users can cancel their flights or update a reservations' information.
